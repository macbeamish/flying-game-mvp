## Web AR Easter Game - Flappy Bird Style Game

This Web based Augmented Reality Game was developed as a research and development project as part of an internship with GEOAR Games https://www.geoargames.com/.
The goal of the project was to explore the available open source technologies for web AR,
with a special focus on ensuring compatibility with older mobile devices.

The game is built using the AFrame and MindAR libraries and the entity component model.
