## Web AR Easter Game - Flappy Bird Style Game

This Web based Augmented Reality Game was developed as a research and development project as part of an internship with GEOAR Games https://www.geoargames.com/.
The goal of the project was to explore the available open source technologies for web AR,
with a special focus on ensuring compatibility with older mobile devices.
My challenge was to recreate one of the company's existing unity based AR seasonal minigames into a web based version written in JavaScript.

The game is built using the AFrame and MindAR libraries and the entity component model.
To play a simple 3D non AR version of the game built for testing use https://flying-game-test.netlify.app/non-ar-flying-game.html

Press play and then Click or tap on the screen to make the character fly

To play the augmented reality version of the game open this link to launch the hosted version https://flying-game-test.netlify.app/
